# Module-Keyboard-PS2-USB
- This is the project about Keyboard(PS2|USB), I designed a Keyboard module using for PS2 or USB and this module using UART protocol with constant baudrate (9600).

- My Attiny13 source code is optimized from Arduino (first Keyboard source code version) and i programmed on Atmel IDE (V7.0)

- All of the instructions in KeyBoard_UserManual.pdf file.

# This is how we uploading code to Attiny13 from USBASP : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9CVWHnCDWk
